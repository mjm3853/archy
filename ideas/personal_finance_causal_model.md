# Appendix: Personal Finance Causal Model

## The "World" to Model

A user's holistic financial ecosystem (Income, Expenses, Debt, Investments, and Market Conditions).

## Causal Structure Examples

- **Back-door Path**: Inflation (U) -> Interest Rates (X) and Cost of Living (Y). To see the effect of Interest Rates on Savings, the system must control for the "hidden" Inflation confounder.

- **Mediation (Front-door)**: Career Training (X) -> Skill Acquisition (M) -> Salary Increase (Y). The system calculates the NIE (how much the training actually improves skills) vs. NDE (pure credentialism).

- **Graph Surgery (do-calculus)**: What happens if I do(Cancel All Subscriptions)? The system deletes natural spending triggers to simulate pure savings growth.

## Conversational Scenarios

- **Counterfactual**: "If I had invested in the S&P 500 instead of buying that car in 2020, what would my net worth be today?" (Abduction of market conditions + Action + Prediction).

- **Self-Awareness**: "I am recommending a high-yield savings account because my internal model of the current yield curve suggests it is the optimal risk-free path for your liquidity level."

## Data Integration

Connects to bank APIs (Memory) to observe natural behavior, then uses the Semantic Translator to turn "Can I afford this?" into a formal mediation analysis of long-term solvency.
